\usage{
ov_setter_repetition(
  x,
  setter_id,
  setter_name,
  exclude_attacks = c("PP", "PR", "P2"),
  exclude_negative_reception = TRUE,
  exclude_highballs = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data.frame: the \code{plays} data.frame as returned by \code{\link[datavolley:dv_read]{datavolley::read_dv()}} or \code{\link[peranavolley:pv_read]{peranavolley::pv_read()}}}

\item{setter_id}{string: (optional) the player ID of the setter to analyze (or provide \code{setter_name}). If neither \code{setter_id} nor \code{setter_name} are provided, all setters will be analyzed separately, and collated results returned}

\item{setter_name}{string: (optional) the name of the setter to analyze (ignored if \code{setter_id} is provided). If neither \code{setter_id} nor \code{setter_name} are provided, all setters will be analyzed separately, and collated results returned}

\item{exclude_attacks}{character: vector of attack codes to exclude}

\item{exclude_negative_reception}{logical: if \code{TRUE}, exclude attacks following poor reception (likely to be out-of-system and therefore might not represent attacks on which the setter had genuine options)}

\item{exclude_highballs}{logical: if \code{TRUE}, exclude highball attacks (likely to be out-of-system and therefore might not represent attacks on which the setter had genuine options)}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns "team", "setter_name", "setter_id", "player_name", "player_id", "category", "opportunities", "repeats", "repeat\%"
}
\description{
Note: analysis is done on the basis of attack actions, and simply assumes that the setter on court made the set.

x <- plays(ovdata_example("NCA-CUB", as = "parsed"))
